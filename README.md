### Instructions to use Gitlab:

Before you start working, please create a new branch locally from the master, push your code locally 
so that your changes aren't lost. When you are ready to push your code to the remote repository, get the
latest version of the master to ensure they are no conflicts with your local branch. Push your branch
to the remote repository and create a pull request or a merge request to merge the code into master. 
Assign the merge request/pull request to a peer and please do not merge it yourself.

When you start working on a new issue/task remember to update your master in the local, everytime you 
create a new branch to work on from the master, it creates a copy from the master present in your local
and not the remote repository, Hence please try and keep the latest version of the master in your local.
